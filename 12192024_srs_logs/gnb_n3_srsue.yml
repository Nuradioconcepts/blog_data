# This example configuration outlines how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to create a single FDD cell
# transmitting in band 3, with 20 MHz bandwidth and 15 kHz sub-carrier-spacing. A USRP B200 is configured 
# as the RF frontend using split 8, with a Leo Bodnar GPSDO as an external reference clock. 

# This particular configuration is intended to be used with srsUE. Note the `pdcch` parameters set in the 
# `cell_cfg` section. These are set to match the capabilities of srsUE.
